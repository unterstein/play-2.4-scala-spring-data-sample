# A quick walkthrough how to enable CDI for spring data (neo4j) for play 2.4 with scala

Update 2.4 for the playframeork was a little bit tricky in terms of CDI (and scala / spring). I had problems getting my spring contexts start again. Therefore i needed to introduced spring-guice.

In this repository i will show the needed X steps to kickstart the project.

# Step 1 - Init the project

The initial step using "activator new -> play-scala" template and writing the skeleton of this README.

# Step 2 - Add dependencies

# Step 3 - Add spring module (yeah, you need a module now!)

# Step 4 - Add (sample) data model and repositories

# Step 5 - Adapt controller to use repository

# Step 6 - Add test data
